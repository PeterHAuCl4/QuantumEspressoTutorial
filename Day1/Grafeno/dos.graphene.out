     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on       4 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                 1
     Threads/MPI process:                     4

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./outdir/Graphene_1x1_PBE.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
                           (   1   4   3   4   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
